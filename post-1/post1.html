              There is currently a rising trend for Artificial Intelligence in
              our digital landscape. The popularity of generative AI programs
              such as ChatGBT and MidJourney is contributing to the rapid growth
              of generative AI. Developers depend on AI to finish their work
              faster. Even large companies are also taking part in this new
              trend and are starting to implement AI in their software. A great
              example of this can be shown through companies like Google and
              Microsoft, who are currently trying to see if they can improve
              their search engines by applying AI. Thanks to generative AI, it
              can quickly finish work faster and help produce new content. After
              hearing about all the wonders AI can do, I was wondering about its
              potential use in my field. To give a brief background about
              myself, I am currently studying Digital Media and Design and my
              concentration is in Web Interactivity and Design. I aspire to
              become a front-end Developer and Designer. Since I work a lot
              around code and web development, there are several ways that I can
              use AI in my workflow. One method is that it can help me by
              writing code. Thanks to AI’s generative nature, It saves a ton of
              time by producing code more quickly. This eliminates the need for
              writing code manually, and allows me to concentrate on other
              important tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and efficiently test
              and debug code. This can save me from hours of stress and
              frustration. Another potential use for Generative AI in my
              workflow is that it can be used to create designs and images.
              Applications like DALL-E, allow users to generate images through a
              written prompt. I won’t have to worry about coming up with a
              fresh, interesting design, and will save me a lot of time.
              Although there are a lot of benefits to the use of AI, it does
              bring up some ethical concerns. I oppose the use of AI in the arts
              since it relies on work from artists. It violates the artist’s
              intellectual property rights and steals away potential job
              opportunities for artists. Because of this, artists are starting
              to impose copyright lawsuits against generative AI tools. AI tools
              such as Midjourney are facing lawsuits for allegedly violating
              copyright laws by stealing artists’ work and using it to train
              their AI without permission (The Verge). I understand that using
              AI sounds intriguing due to its ability to quickly produce
              content, but it also raises concerns such as copyright
              infringement and the possibility of taking away jobs from people.
              While I am not entirely opposed to the use of AI, as it saves so
              much time when it comes to code and development, it does undermine
              the authenticity of art. The uniqueness and originality of art
              produced by humans are being replaced by AI-generated art. Whether
              AI art can truly be recognized as “art” and of itself is a
              difficult question for many. As for my response, AI-generated art
              should never be accepted as authentic art.
